# grr changelog

## not yet released

## 1.9.0

- [pull #15] Add support to allow users to grant cr/ia +1s on reviews
  This allows users to pass '-R cr' or '-R ia' to grant CR or IA
  approval on reviews. With the addition of '-d', we print the review
  status of reviews matching the argument, show a diff, and prompt
  the user to grant the approval.

  With '-n', we do a dry-run of granting the approval. Without -d,
  we only list the current approval status of matching reviews.

## 1.8.0

- [issue #12] Add support for multiple issues. (Work mostly by John Levon.)
  This adds the concept of "extra issues" that your CR covers. You can
  specify extra issues initially via:

        grr <main-issue> <extra-issue-1> <extra-issue-2> ...
        grr TRITON-123   TRITON-124 OS-456

  or after you've started via:

        grr -a TRITON-124,OS-456

  You can remove extra issues from a CR via:

        grr -r TRITON-124

  Extra issues will be included in the commit message. E.g. for our
  contrived example:

        TRITON-123 VMAPI metrics test fails in nightly
        TRITON-124 add node-triton support for bhyve
        OS-456 constant dhcp NAKs
        Reviewed-By: ...

## 1.7.0

- [pull #11] Add `grr -L` to list open CRs for the current repository.

## 1.6.0

- Update grr to use the new https://jira.joyent.us

## 1.5.2

- Avoid adding a "Reviewed by: ..." to a CR for a *-1* review.

## 1.5.1

- [pull #2] Get `grr` working with an older git (git 1.7 is Dave's case).

## 1.5.0

- When pushing new commits the author of the latest commit will be used, rather
  than necessarily you. That means you can make a slight tweak to someone
  else's CR, commit your tweak with `git commit --author="The Other Guy
  <guy@example.com>" ...` and then run `grr` without stealing credit for all
  the real work.

## 1.4.0

- Change to using 'grr-$issue' instead of 'grr/$issue' for the created working
  branch, because the '/' might cause issues with Joyent `TRY_BRANCH` builds.

## 1.3.2

- Release 1.3.1 broke things. Fix that.

## 1.3.1

- Allow the origin git URL to not have trailing ".git".

## 1.3.0

- `grr -p PARENTHETICAL` to add a parenthetical to the commit message. Usage:

        $ grr -p "fix make check" ISSUE
        ...
        $ git commit -am "..."
        $ grr

## 1.2.4

- Correct `gerritUsername` in the fix in 1.2.3.


## 1.2.3

**Bad release. Use 1.2.4.**

- Need to use the gerritUsername (that was determined earlier) when doing "ssh
  cr.joyent.us".


## 1.2.2

- Fix `grr` in a branch with a stored JIRA issue. (This was broken in v1.1.0).


## 1.2.1

- Fix `grr -D` assert on `opts.dryRun`.


## 1.2.0

- `grr` will update the commit message to include "Reviewed by" and
  "Approved by" lines according to approvals on the latest patchset.


## 1.1.1

- Fix `AssertionError: opts.dryRun (bool) is required` error for every
  invocation.

## 1.1.0

**Bad release. Use 1.1.1.**

- Support GitHub issues.

- The `<issue>` CLI argument supports a few forms (e.g. the full URL) to simplify
  cutting and pasting:

        grr TOOLS-1531
        grr https://jira.joyent.us/browse/TOOLS-1531
        grr 6
        grr https://github.com/joyent/sdc-triton/issues/6
        grr joyent/sdc-triton#6

- Added commit messages are posted as a review message on the CR.

## 1.0.0

First working version.
